# UFOs

## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to take a data file in javascript and create a website that could filter the data for the user.  We wanted the user to be able to see what data they wanted easily by filtering it by the date, city, state, country or shape of the ufo.

## Results
### How to Search
The search tool is very self explanatory and easy to use for the user.  There are input areas for the user to use on the left hand side of the site, and the data is on the right.  If a user wanted to find what UFOs were spotted in Arizona they would go to the state input box and input 'ar'.  This would filter the data and bring up this result.
